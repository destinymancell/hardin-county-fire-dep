We ran into a lot of problems through CSS and HTML. We would get one thing figured out then another would appear when we tried something else most of the time. The main problem was with the pictures and font size. 
The pictures ended up not going in the middle no matter how many times we asked for helped and searched for different ways to get it in the middle.

We did the best we could for being completely new at this.

Challenges: The CSS was a huge problem with our website. We ran into issue after issue with it. The pictures won't center align and we finally got the font fixed, but overall everything was okay.

The site isn't mobile friendly.
