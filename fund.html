	<h1>Firefighter Support Fund</h1> 

		<p>The Savannah and Hardin County Firefighters Support Fund was established to help our firefighters and the families in their time of need. If an active firefighter or a member of their immediate family is injured or hospitialized and requires travel or time lost from work for them or their dependants the Fund will donate up to $200.00.</p>
		
		<p>Immediate family includes spouse and thieir children below the age of 18. If a Department or District would like to organize a benifit for an individual in their department the fund will donate up to $100.00 to help with startup costs. Any additional or special requests for funds will be discussed and voted on by the Firefighter's Support Fund.</p>
